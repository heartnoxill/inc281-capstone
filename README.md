## Short Details

Running simulated IoT system that mimics the real hydroponic farm. The components are mainly divided into two sections, Digital and Analog.

- Digital: Water Pump Switch, Air Pump Switch, Bird Detection Buzzer Switch, Water Level Danger Switch
- Analog: Temperature Sensor (LM35), Light Intensity Sensor (LDR), Relative Humidity Sensor (HIH-5030), and pH sensor (there were no practical pH sensor in Proteus program, so we used potentiometer to imitate the voltage output from the sensor.
- Output (Digital): Water Pump, Air Pump, Bird Detection Buzzer, Water Level Danger
- Output (Analog): Temperature Fan, Humidifier Fan, Plant Growing Lamp
